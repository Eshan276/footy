# footy

Repository for the app development of a football (soccer) tic tac toe app in python.

Here I first gathered the data via WebScraping from transfermarkt.com.
Then I developed a database system, where the data ideally follows some normalization rules.
Finally, the app logic is implemented with the kivy library.
